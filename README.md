# Loan-Classification-with-Python---IBM-course

In this notebook we try to practice all the classification algorithms that we have learned in the IBM machine learning with Python course.

We load a loan dataset using Pandas library, and apply the algorithms, including KNN, SVM, Decision Tree, and Logistic Regression, and find the best one for this specific dataset by accuracy evaluation methods.
